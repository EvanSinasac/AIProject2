Project 2

This program was built in Unity 2020.3.25f1 Personal.  The purpose of this project is to show off our skills in developing formation behaviours with a group of entities, maintaining the formation shape, flocking and path following.

CONTROLS
WASD			- Move camera
Right Click		- Hold to change camera angle, WASD control is relative to direction camera is facing
1			- Set formation to Circle
2			- Set formation to V
3			- Set formation to Square
4			- Set formation to Line
5			- Set formation to Two Rows
6			- Change behaviour to Flocking
7			- Return to Formation behaviour
8			- Begin path following
9			- Reverse path order
0			- Stop path following
-			- Start following path while flocking
=			- Stop following path and stop flocking
Z/X			- Increase/Decrease cohesion weight
C/V			- Increase/Decrease separation weight
B/N			- Increase/Decrease alignment weight

Units
The units are generated by the GenerateFlock script on Minions 2, the coordinator searches the scene for every Game Object with the tag "Unit" and places them in the vehicles array.  Pressing the number keys changes various booleans and other variables within the scripts to change what behaviour or formation for the units to follow.

My error checking for the flocking weights could use some work, but I figured what's there is good enough for rock and roll.  It was not part of the assignment description but I decided a button to turn off the Flocking/Follow path behaviour would be useful rather than try and figure out what combination of keys to press to turn them both off.

There's only so many ways to really do steering behaviours, so I've taken what we've been working on in class and made any necessary modifications to re-purpose it for this project.

Anything else I think I might need to cover will be in the recorded demo, can't really think of anything else to put here.
